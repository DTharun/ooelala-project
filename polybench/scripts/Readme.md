Utility scripts for running Polybench benchmarks

1. Copy scripts to Polybench install directory (../)
2. ./<script>

getStats.sh - build all the benchmarks to get their stats and move them to specified directory
Note - it will move ALL the stats files to the directory and seperate them based on compiler (clang and clang-unseq folders)

compareStats.py - compare stat files generated by clang and ooelala(clang-unseq)
Note - use `python compareStats.py -h` for usage instructions

timeBenchmark.sh - get the run time for an individual benchmark with specified compiler and number of runs (median is taken)

compareTimes.py - compare the run times for all the benchmarks across all specified compilers
Note - use `python compareTimes.py -h` for usage instructions

getAllResults.sh - one command to run all selected benchmarks
